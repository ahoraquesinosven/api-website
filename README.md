# api-website

Headless CMS API for the public site for the Observatorio de las Violencias de Género “Ahora Que Sí Nos Ven”.

This is a customized [strapi](https://strapi.io/) API set up using [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) as a database.

## Development

### Prerequisites

We use a dockerized development environment, so you will need [docker](https://www.docker.com/) on your machine and also [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). No other dependencies are required in your machine.

### Quick start

* Run `docker-compose up`. This will take a bit the first time since the docker images need to be built or downloaded. Once done, the strapi admin console can be accessed at http://localhost:1337/admin
